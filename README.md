Cerinta proiect 1:
Implement  a  library/program  in  a  programming  language  of your choosing to load and validate a DFA input file.
Implement  a  library/program  in  a  programming  language  ofyour choosing to test acceptance of a DFA

Cerinta proiect 2:
Extend  the  library/program  you  implemented  in  Project_1 tol oad and validate a NFA input file 
Implement  a  library/program  in  a  programming  language  ofyour choosing to test acceptance of a NFA. (bonus) Implement a library/program in a
programming lan-guage of your choosing to test acceptance of anε−NFA

Cerinta proiect 3:
Implement a library/program in a programming language ofyour choosing to simulate the Myhill-Nerode theorem - minimize a DFA to thesmallest DFA with the same level ofcompleteness.
(bonus) Implement a library/program in a programming lan-guage of your choosing to minimize a DFA to the smallest (potentially) incom-plete DFA.

Cerinta proiect 4:
Iplement a program in a programming language of your choosing to crawl a category of the ads listing website olx.ro and generate auto-matic sub-categorizations of the listings using regular expressions.For the purpose of crawling and navigating through the HTML DOM tree, you may use any specialized library you wish, in any programming language.
For maximum score you  must  build  at  least 10 sub-categorization  filters,  and  display  the results into a webpage.

Cerinta proiect 5:
Create  a  program-readable  format  to  fully  describe  aCon-text Free Grammar.    Your  format  should  differentiate  between  terminals,non-terminals, productions and start point.Implement  a  library/program  in  a  programming  language  of  your  choosing  toload and validate a CFG in the format you created.c f gv a l i d a t i o ne n g i n e . p y    c f gc o n f i gf i l eYou must also include two additional files along with the script:•A READMDE file to describe your format•An example cfgconfigfile input

Cerinta proiect 6:

Implement a library/program (in a programming language
of your choice) to load and validate a configuration file of a TM with one head
and two tapes. Also implement a simulator for this type of TM

Cerinta proiect 7:

 Create a configuration file for a one head, two tapes TM
that recognize the language L = {w#w|where w is a string} and also check for
the integrity of the tapes (if they are identical).
